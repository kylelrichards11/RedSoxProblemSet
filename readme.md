# Red Sox Problem Set

# Getting Started
This code was created and run on Linux (Ubuntu 20.04), I do not guarantee that it will run on other operating systems. Additionally, because of the somewhat large size of the data, and because I have a local GPU, I use the RAPIDSAI suite of packages for easy GPU computing. Therefore, this code requires a NVIDIA GPU with CUDA enabled to run. See [https://rapids.ai/start.html](https://rapids.ai/start.html) for installation via conda.
